# Spline-Lagrange-QUANC8

The program calculates the value of the function for a given x and a given step using the QUANC8 program. Builds a spline function and a Lagrange polynomial of degree 10 from the obtained points. Compares the values of the spline function and the polynomial with the exact value of the function.
